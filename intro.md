### What's TypeScript?
TS is an open source, typed `syntactic superset` of JavaScript
- Compiles to readable JS
- Three parts: Language, Language Server & Compiler
- Kind of like fancy linter

### Why developers want types?
It allows you, as a code author, to leave more of your intent "on the page"

### Agenda
- using `tsc` and **compiling** TS code into JavaScript
- `Variables` and simple values
- `Objects` and arrays
- Categorizing `type systems`
- Set theory, Union and Intersection types
- Interfaces and Type aliases
- Hack
- Functions
- Classes
- Top & bottom types
- User-defined Type guards
